  1. Income Withholding in purchase operations.
-
  1.1 I configure the test enviroment and check data and demo.
-
  I set the company as a income withhholdig agent.
-
    !record {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner}:
        islr_withholding_agent: True
-
  I check that the company is a income withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner, string: The companu is a non-withholdable agent}:
       - islr_withholding_agent
-
  I check that only one non-withholdable concept is define.
-
    !python {model: islr.wh.concept}: |
       iwc_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [( 'withholdable', '=', False )])
       assert len(iwc_ids) == 1, ( 'Only can be defined one non-withhodeable'
           ' concepts, but %s are defined.' % (len(iwc_ids), ))
-
  I check that all the withholdable concepts have accounts type 'other'
  associtated and also have manadory islr rates.
-
    !python {model: islr.wh.concept}: |
       iwc_ids = self.search(cr, uid, [( 'withholdable', '=', True )])
       for iwc_brw in self.browse(cr, uid, iwc_ids):
            assert iwc_brw.rate_ids, 'All the withholdable concepts need to have rates associated'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_payable, 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding purchase acc set.'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_payable.type == 'other', 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding purchase acc of type other.'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_receivable, 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding sale acc set.'
            assert iwc_brw.property_retencion_islr_receivable.type == 'other', 'All the withholdable concepts need to have an income withholding sale acc of type other.'
