  2. I check if the supplier income withholding documents are correctly created. Income Withholding document lines corresponds to the concepts and the amount totalization.
-
  2.1 I configure the test enviroment and check data and demo.
-
  I set the context for the purchase operations at this set of cases.
-

-
  I check that the company is a income withholding agent and is at Venezuela.

           ' concepts, but %s are defined.' % (len(iwc_ids), ))
-
  I check that all the withholdable concepts have accounts type 'other'
  associtated and also have mandatory income rates.

  2.2 I check that one invoice only creates a single one withholding line.
-
   I create a supplier invoice with a withholdable concept.
